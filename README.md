## Introduction
In today's world, email is a key method of communication for personal, business, corporate, and government purposes. With the rise in email usage, there has been a notable increase in spam emails. These spam emails, also known as junk emails, are mass-sent messages that can be both annoying and pose security risks to computer systems. To tackle this issue, machine learning, particularly logistic regression, offers a powerful solution for predicting and filtering spam emails.
